This Jupyter notebook is structured to guide you through the essential stages of data handling, specifically tailored for large datasets. The steps include:  

1. Downloading Data: Automated scripts to fetch data from an online repository, ensuring reproducibility and ease of access.  

2. Organizing Data: Methodically saving the downloaded files in a structured directory. This step emphasizes the importance of a well-organized data storage system for efficient data management.  

3. Loading Data: Scripts to load data from multiple files. This step demonstrates how to handle and consolidate data from various sources, a common scenario in real-world data science projects.  

4. Cleaning Data: Detailed procedures for cleaning the data, tailored to the specific requirements of the intended analysis. This includes handling missing values, removing irrelevant data, and transforming data into a suitable format for analysis.  

5. Saving Processed Data: Strategies for naming and saving the cleaned data in a unique, traceable manner. This practice is essential to avoid confusion with multiple data versions and ensures clarity in data lineage.  

By following this notebook, you'll gain hands-on experience in managing and processing large datasets, an invaluable skill in any data science endeavor.
